"""Integration test: empty checkpoint coalescing with concurrent map + wait.

Python equivalent of the Java MapWithConditionAndCallbackExample referenced in
issue #325. Verifies that when many concurrent map branches resume from timed
wait operations simultaneously, the empty checkpoints produced by the
resubmitter (executor.py) are coalesced into minimal API calls instead of
being split across multiple batches.

Background
----------
When a map branch suspends via TimedSuspendExecution and later resumes, the
ConcurrentExecutor resubmitter calls::

    execution_state.create_checkpoint()  # empty checkpoint

before resubmitting the branch. In high-concurrency scenarios (300+ branches)
all resuming at the same time, 300+ empty checkpoints flood the checkpoint
queue.

Without the coalescing optimization (issue #325), the 250-operation batch limit
causes these to be split across multiple batches → multiple API calls.
With the optimization, all subsequent empty checkpoints beyond the first do
NOT count toward the batch limit, so they are coalesced into a single batch
and a single API call.

These tests directly simulate that concurrent-checkpoint pattern by launching
many threads that each call ``create_checkpoint()`` simultaneously, mirroring
what the map resubmitter does when all branches resume at once.
