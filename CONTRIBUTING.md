# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Dependencies
Install [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/dev/install/).

## Repository Structure

This is a monorepo containing multiple packages under the `packages/` directory:

```
packages/
├── aws-durable-execution-sdk-python/              # Core SDK
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
├── aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-otel/         # OpenTelemetry instrumentation
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
└── aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-examples/     # Example functions and tests
    ├── pyproject.toml
    ├── src/
    └── test/
```

The root `pyproject.toml` defines all shared Hatch environments for testing, type checking, and development. Each package's `pyproject.toml` contains only build metadata, publishing configuration, and package-local tool settings (ruff, coverage, pytest markers).

Shared files (`.github/`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.) live at the repository root.

## Developer workflow

All test, type checking, and development commands are run from the **repository root**:

```bash
# Run all tests across all packages
hatch run test:all

# Run tests with coverage
hatch run test:cov

# Type checking across all packages
hatch run types:check

# Static analysis (per-package, since ruff config is package-local)
for pkg in packages/*/; do (cd "$pkg" && hatch fmt --check); done
```

### Per-package development environments

For focused work on a single package, use the `dev-*` environments from the repo root:

```bash
# Core SDK
hatch run dev-core:test        # run core SDK tests only
hatch run dev-core:cov         # run core SDK tests with coverage
hatch run dev-core:typecheck   # type check core SDK only

# OpenTelemetry package
hatch run dev-otel:test        # run otel tests only
hatch run dev-otel:cov         # run otel tests with coverage
hatch run dev-otel:typecheck   # type check otel only

# Examples
hatch run dev-examples:test    # run examples tests only
```

### PyPI release testing

To verify packages work against the published PyPI version of the core SDK (rather than the local workspace):

```bash
hatch run test-pypi-otel:test       # test otel against PyPI core SDK
hatch run test-pypi-examples:test   # test examples against PyPI core SDK
```

### Package-level commands

Some commands still run from within a package directory:

```bash
cd packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python

# Static analysis with auto-fix
hatch fmt

# Build distribution
hatch build

# Examples deployment (from repo root)
hatch run examples:build
python packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-examples/scripts/generate_sam_template.py --example-name "Hello World" --output packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-examples/template.generated.json
sam build --template-file packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-examples/template.generated.json
sam deploy \
  --template-file .aws-sam/build/template.yaml \
  --stack-name hello-world-python-dev \
  --resolve-s3 \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --no-confirm-changeset \
  --parameter-overrides FunctionName=HelloWorld-Python LambdaEndpoint=https://lambda.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

### CI checks script

There is a convenience script that runs all checks (tests, types, lint) from the root of the repo:
```
.github/scripts/ci-checks.sh
```

This script also validates your commit messages against the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
Commit all your changes before you run the check. If your working directory is dirty the script will skip commit message validation with a warning. 

You can also run the commit message check independently:
```
hatch run python .github/scripts/lintcommit.py
```

## Coding Standards
Consistency is important for maintainability. Please adhere to the house-style of the repo, unless there's a really
good reason to break pattern.

### General style
1. Follow the [Python Style Guide by Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) in general.
2. Standardize to [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) formatting and linting rules. CI checks enforce these too.
3. Avoid pulling in extra runtime dependencies. The only dependency is [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/). The
   reason is that this SDK adds size to the AWS Lambda function of the consumer, so we should keep it as light as
   possible.
4. Never use `RLock` when `Lock` would do. The reason is to highlight recursive calls that have the potential for deadlocking
   immediately, so that RLock is a deliberate and considered decision after having considered deadlocking concerns, rather
   than just the default.

### Organization
1. Do not allow circular references, even if you can get away with it by using `if TYPE_CHECKING`. Circular references are a
   sign that the structure of the code is not clear enough. It makes for inefficient memory management and it makes the
   code harder to understand and follow. Do use `config` and `types` as the lowest-level import if you run into circular
   reference issues.
2. Do not use `__init__` files for any meaningful code or even just type declarations. Why? Because the purpose of init is not
   to serve as a grab-bag of code that doesn't otherwise have a home.
3. Do not introduce `utils` or `helper` style modules as a grab-bag of ad hoc functions. Introduce domain-specific classes to
   encapsulate and model logic.

### Data Structures & Typing
1. Model data structure with immutable classes and precise type hints. (In other words, use frozen dataclasses with exact,
   narrow type hints.) Do not rely on unstructured dicts. Why immutable? These are inherently thread-safe, and it forces you
   to think carefully about when and where you need to mutate values.

2. A rare exception to the general rule to prefer immutable classes wherever possible, is `state.ExecutionState`, which maintains
   the state of the on-going Durable Execution and encapsulates thread-safe state mutations as the execution progresses.

3. Rely on exact and explicit type declarations rather than duck typing. Why? Yes, duck typing is very pythonic. However, this
   is a complex code-base, and exact and explicit type declarations signal intent clearly so that the type checker can help
   you catch errors more quickly. LLMs have an easier time understanding the intent of the code with the type hints, and it makes
   it easier for you to spot mistaken assumptions that the LLMs might make about the code. The other reason is that it makes the
   experience of developers much easier with intelligent and context-aware autocomplete hints in an IDE.

4. Declare a type definition wherever you declare a variable, even within a function scope and even where it's implied. For example,
   even though the `str` might be _implied_ because of the `call` return type, make it explicit:

```
def my_function() -> str:
  my_var: str = arb.call(1, 2, 3)
  return f"arb result: {my_var}"
```

5. To update a field in a frozen dataclass, prefer to use a `clone` or `with_field` class method constructor or reinitialization,
   rather than dataclass `replace`. There is no big technical reason for this, it's more a soft pattern. The philosophy of an update
   should be more about thoughfully and purposefully creating a _new_ instance than "in-place editing" an existing one.


### Initialization and conversion
1. Class constructors must be light and not do more than initialize the class. In a dataclass you shouldn't even need an `__init__`.
   Use a `@classmethod` factory method instead to encapsulate more advanced logic. For example, if a class depends on logic that
   might fail, encapsulate this in a `create` classmethod:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class MyClass:
    id: str
    name: str
    timeout: int
    
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, name: str, timeout: int = 30) -> Config:
        """Factory contains """
        if timeout <= 0:
            raise ValueError("timeout must be positive")
        
        # Generate unique ID
        config_id: str = f"cfg_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
        
        return cls(id=config_id, name=name, timeout=timeout)
```

2. Encapsulate conversion logic in a `from_x` factory and `to_x` method on a class.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class WaitOptions:
    wait_seconds: int = 0

    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, data: MutableMapping[str, Any]) -> WaitOptions:
        return cls(wait_seconds=data.get("WaitSeconds", 0))

    def to_dict(self) -> MutableMapping[str, Any]:
        return {"WaitSeconds": self.wait_seconds}
```

## Set up your IDE
Point your IDE at the hatch virtual environment to have it recognize dependencies
and imports. You can use either the root environment (for cross-package work) or a
per-package dev environment (for focused work).

You can find the path to the hatch Python interpreter like this:
```
# From the repo root — use the dev environment for the package you're working on
hatch env find dev-core
hatch env find dev-otel
hatch env find dev-examples
```

### VS Code
#### Interpreter
If you're using VS Code, "Python: Select Interpreter" and use the hatch venv Python interpreter
as found with the `hatch env find` command.

Kiro and VS Code mangles the interpreter path if it contains spaces, which results in
errors finding the interpreter. You can create a local .venv file symlink _without_ spaces
in the path:

```bash
# From the repo root — symlink the dev environment you want to use
rm -rf .venv && ln -s "$(hatch env find dev-core)" .venv
```

When you "Select Interpreter", enter path `./.venv/bin/python`.

You'll have to rerun this command whenever you recreate your hatch envs.

#### Linting
Hatch uses Ruff for static analysis.

You might want to install the [Ruff extension for VS Code](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode)
to have your IDE interactively warn of the same linting and formatting rules.

These `settings.json` settings are useful:
```
{
  "[python]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll": "explicit",
      "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
    },
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff"
  },
  "ruff.nativeServer": "on"
}
```

## Testing
### How to run tests
Run these commands from the **repository root**:

To run all tests across all packages:
```
hatch run test:all
```

To run tests for a specific package:
```
hatch run dev-core:test
hatch run dev-otel:test
hatch run dev-examples:test
```

To run a single test file:
```
hatch run dev-core:test packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python/tests/path_to_test_module.py
```

To run a specific test in a module:
```
hatch run dev-core:test packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python/tests/path_to_test_module.py::test_mytestmethod
```

To run a subset of tests by pattern:
```
hatch run test:all -k TEST_PATTERN
```

This will run tests which contain names that match the given string expression (case-insensitive),
which can include Python operators that use filenames, class names and function names as variables.

### Debug
To debug failing tests:

```
$ hatch test --pdb
```

This will drop you into the Python debugger on the failed test.

### Writing tests
Place test files in the `tests/` directory, using file names that end with `_test`.

Mimic the package structure in the src/aws_durable_execution_sdk_python directory.
Name your module so that src/mypackage/mymodule.py has a dedicated unit test file
tests/mypackage/mymodule_test.py

## Examples and Deployment

Run these commands from the **repository root**.

To run examples tests from the repo root:
```bash
hatch run dev-examples:test
```

### Build and Deploy Examples
```bash
# Build the shared example bundle with vendored dependencies
hatch run examples:build

# Generate the checked-in SAM template for the full catalog
hatch run examples:generate-sam-template

# Generate a one-example SAM template for deployment
python packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-examples/scripts/generate_sam_template.py \
  --example-name "Hello World" \
  --output packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-examples/template.generated.json

# Build and deploy that example with SAM
sam build --template-file packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-examples/template.generated.json
sam deploy \
  --template-file .aws-sam/build/template.yaml \
  --stack-name hello-world-python-dev \
  --resolve-s3 \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --no-confirm-changeset \
